The difference between divs, classes, ids and spans are they help style your webpage. The different classes are telling the computer to do add a specific to a certain part. The ids just help identify a specific element. The divs help create structure on the webpage which helps with readability. The spans help tell the computer that it needs to look unique and need a class or id to function. Sometimes with using a service like youtube or sound cloud not all browsers support the same format. You also have little control on how you want it to look and there could be ads. What is nice is that there is a less hassle and can be a little bit easier. This week I found that the little things matter and if you miss one little step than the whole webpage will be off. I also got more clarity on questions that should help on future assignments.
