The site I chose to look at was CNN. I chose to compare it from July 7, 2010 to the current site that is up and running now. As for the looks, they looked pretty similar besides a few things. Some things I noticed that were similar were all the different topics you could shoose from listed at the top. Also the main news stories were front and center right when you went to the website. Some things that were diffferent was the format because on the one from 2010 it had things like a "sign in" button or a search bar whereas on the current website there are just little icons to resemble those things. This might be to help the website look more clean cut and modern. Also on the current website there was an add on the top which is very eye catching since it was very large on the screen.
My experience with all this is still very tedious with certain things because I feel if you miss one little step then it messes up the whole thing. This takes a lot more practice then I originally had thought. And sometimes things look different on my computer then the examples that are given, so that can be a little confusing sometimes.
