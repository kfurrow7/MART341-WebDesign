            Aspen, in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains, is a ski resort town and year-round destination for outdoor recreation. It's also known for high-end restaurants and boutiques, and landmarks like the Wheeler Opera House, built in 1889 during the area’s silver mining boom. The Wheeler-Stallard House is a local history museum set in a 19th-century, Queen Anne–style home, while the Aspen Art Museum displays contemporary artworks.

            Aspen offers an abundance of deep snow and a vast expanse of terrain that includes 94 trails and the largest vertical descent of any resort in North America. With excellent dining facilities across the mountain, tubing lanes, the Breathtaker Alpine Coaster, and the Treehouse Kids Adventure Center at the base, Aspen is also a favorite among families and groups. With the newly redesigned and enhanced Base Village including a larger Four Mountain Sports and a new Limelight Hotel Snowmass, this mountain keeps proving that it only gets better and better.

            There is no denying the unique personality of Aspen Mountain. Rising from the vibrant heart of downtown Aspen, this is where it all began in 1946 with the single-seat Lift 1, which immediately became the longest chairlift in the world. That mentality of “go big or go home” has always been at the foundation of the mountain they still call “Ajax.”

            The soul of a mountain town, the buzz of a city. The town of Aspen is loved for the way it balances these traits so gracefully. With its historic architecture, pedestrian- and bike-friendly streets, sophisticated shops and galleries, and vibrant dining and nightlife, Aspen is truly among the world’s great mountain towns.
