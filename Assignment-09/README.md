All of this was new to me and there was always something that was challenging, but it has gotten easier. I think structure is really hard to learn just because the smallest thing throws it off. In this upcoming section I'm excited to be able to decorate more and really make it your own. I am nervous it might be a little more tedious. To over come my challenges I really tried to pay attention to detail or went and looked back at previous assignments.
