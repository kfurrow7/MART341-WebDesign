          Recognized for its idyllic setting and climate, great skiing and outdoor recreation, fantastic dining, high-end shopping, and as a popular retreat for celebrities and affluent travelers, Aspen has something for everyone. Its rich history and outdoor access add complexity to its reputation as an apres-ski, party town. And sitting close to 8,000 feet in the Roaring Fork Valley among the Elk Mountains, Aspen is considered one of Colorado's best outdoor playgrounds.

            Residents transitioned from miners to farmers and ranchers until the late 1930s, when skiing and the intelligencia made an appearance for the first time. Andre Roch, the famous Swiss avalanche expert, was hired to survey the area for a world-class ski resort. At that same time, locals took to Ajax and built their own "boat tow" ski lift and cleared the mountain's first run, naming it Roch's Run. Six years later, the historic Lift 1A carried its first skiers up Ajax. After that, it was all skiing, all the time.

          And Aspen's renaissance didn't stop there. With tremendous help from Walter Paepcke, the town became a center of intellect, music, literature, art, and theater. His mark on the Aspen community still lives on today through the Aspen Idea: a community focused on mind, body, and spirit. In the 1960s, skiing expanded to Buttermilk, Highlands, and Snowmass ski areas, and the town filled with high-rollers, hippies, and intellectuals.

            Aspen's vibrant, athletic, and unique culture today, is a tribute to its varied cast of characters and storied past. Whether it's the arts, idyllic setting, fantastic climate, or outdoor activities that lure you here, it's ground zero for a vacation unlike any other.

          The best time to visit Aspen is from December to February. The town sparkles when it's buried under fresh powder, and its slopes are ready to be taken by storm. Keep in mind that this is the most popular time to visit, so prices will likely be elevated, but you can find some deals if you plan a few months in advance. Aspen's second high season occurs between June and August, with temperatures in the high 70s â€“ the perfect atmosphere for a mountain hike. To save money, consider visiting in the spring or fall, making sure to plan a few weeks ahead to secure a hotel that's open in the offseason.
