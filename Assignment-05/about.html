A little bit about Munro Leaf created one of the most famous children's book called Ferdinand. 
He was born in Maryland and studied at University of Maryland and Harvard University where he achieved getting his masters in English. 
His carreer was 40 years long which he illustrated children's books. 
Since Ferdinand is his most popular children's book and one of my favorites I will give you a short descrption of the story line. 
Ferdiand is a gentle bull who lives in rural spain who perfers to smell flowers rather then bullfight like the other bulls. 
With that being said it started a controversy because some viewers believed it was a pacifist symbol. 
Despite all these negative views this book was translated in over 60 foreign languages and was soon adapted into a Walt Disney's film.
