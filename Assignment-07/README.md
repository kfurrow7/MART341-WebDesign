Anytime I have been on a clothing website they always have an option to enter your email for new arrival updates or where you can find an electronic receipt etc. The purpose is to get you involved with the store to hopefully sell more items and popularize the business more. All of them usually use autofocus on things when you are filling out a form or when they really want to grab your attention with things like sales. My work cycle for this assignment was kind of struggling with the way things look, so that was just a little frustrating because I have an image in my head of what I want it to look like. Overall this assignment went pretty well.
