The border is very simple and defines the amount of space an element takes up. It also as multiple style options. Padding adds more cushion and is the space between the inner content and the element itself. The margin is the space between the box/element and can be used to set it top, right, bottom or left. I tried moving my last two pictures one to the right and one to the center and it was not doing that in my style doc, so I'm not really sure.
