Web Design Assignment 2

1.	The world wide web is different than the internet because the internet is basically networks that are used across the globe. Now the world wide web does not function without the internet, but stores information accessed from the internet. Also, the internet is needed for operation of a society or enterprise and the web is an add on feature of that.
2.	The internet is operated by a whole bunch of software’s and hardware’s and moves data from one to place another. A term commonly used is “packet switching” which means that it sends data in pieces so we can communicate, browse and share things. It all tags it to the destination you are looking for.
3.	Directory files hold on to the information for the system to operate properly, but do not actually hold the data that’s in the file. With that being said directories take up less space giving a file structure and flexibility. Also, an individual directory is in some way a file.
4.	VCS stands for venture capitalist. Some benefits they can provide for you would be investing with a huge company making billions. VCs have a good business knowledge and can provide guidance and consultation for startup businesses. So, they help with things like financial management which is a key area and is vital for business growth. Another benefit is additional resources, providing active support. Lastly the connections that VCs provide are huge since they are so involved in the business community. 
5.	My favorite kind of art is probably music or movies because they both bring people together and make you feel a certain way. There are so many different genres and for me I’m very infatuated on how well movies are produced these days and how much they have developed. When a movie can provoke an emotion, I think that’s pretty cool. Now music I feel like is an escape and can either hype you up, relax you, make you feel good. Most people connect with lyrics and is a way to express themselves.
