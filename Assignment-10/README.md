The universal selector is indicated by (*) and it selects everything in the document. A class selector starts with a dot (.) and it will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. An ID selector begins with a (#) and is used in the same way as a class selector. My colors were light pink 	#FFB6C1 RGB(255, 182, 193),  Turquoise #40E0D0 RGB(64, 224, 208),  Light blue #ADD8E6 RGB(173, 216, 230). What I found to be the most difficult is my webpage actually working properly. I was having a hard time for it to get the colors or effects I wanted it to have.
